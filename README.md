# Installation

# Usage
You need to open Elite Dangerous first, sign in and connect to a session (open/private/solo). After this open this program. Go back to elite and start doing mission pickups and killing. It requires no user interaction at all and it will synchronize everything from the current session. ***It can not load missions kills and others from previous sessions!***
## Reloading 
To reload a session click "file..." on the upper left and select load and there select the .json file with the correct name. It has an auto save and load feature. The autosave creates save files like this: autobackup_target_system_name.json.
## Adding missions
The app handles it automaticaly
## Saving
To save a session click "file..." on the upper left and select save and there write a name on the bottom field. The session will be saved under that_name.json.
## The right panel
By default this panel is empty. As you go and pick up missions it should start to fill up.
This panel contains the system hierarchy. When expanded you will see a format like this:
system_main:
system1:
station1:
\[number\]faction1
\[number\]faction2
station2:
etc
Here the numbers indicating the stack hight for the given faction.
## The left panel
There are 2 modes in this view:
The pick up mode:
In this mode you will see a table as you pick up more and more missions. While killing you should look this tab, since it synchronizes the kills you have already made and tells you how many kills you have left on each missions.
The share mode:
When you have completed the missions you should look this tab. This tab contains the necessary information for mission sharing and it collapses all items automatically except the station that you are docked to.
## The slider
The slider is a theorethical kill counter. The max is set to the stack height all the time (not synchronizing with completed missions).
